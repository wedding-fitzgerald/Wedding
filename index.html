            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <hr class="our-story-line">
            <p>
                Matthew and Emma met in 2018 at Lagoon Amusement Park. At the time Matt was in charge of training Emma
                to be the best Games Attendant in the department.
                Little did they know that someday they would be getting married. Two years later the couple became
                supervisors, they didn’t interact much their first year
                as supervisors. However, their second year as supervisors Emma was given Matthew’s number by a friend
                and they began to talk on a daily basis. Shortly after
                they started texting, they started hanging out outside of work. Then on Emma’s 18th birthday the couple
                had their first kiss at the drive-in movie theater that
                has since been closed. The next day Matthew grew a pair and asked Emma to be his girlfriend. The rest is
                history, the couple enjoy going to Dave and Busters, the
                aquarium, fishing, and the couch to cuddle, play Minecraft and cuddle with Midnight. They got engaged on
                April Fools Day of 2023 on a cruise to Mexico. Emma and
                Matthew have been through a lot together and are excited to spend the rest of their lives together.

                    <h3>About the Groom</h3>
                    <p>
                        Matthew attended college at Weber State University where he graduated with a bachelors degree in
                        Web Design and User Experience as well as a certificate of
                        proficiency in User Experience Design in 2023. He has an addiction to giving it a dangle
                        whenever he can, and feels the need to put ketchup on almost everything
                        he consumes.

                        Emma is the most indecisive yet the most detail-oriented person Matthew has ever met, we still
                        don’t know how she can be both at the same time. She is a Criminal
                        Justice major at UVU intending to go to law school upon graduation. In her free time, she likes
                        to read books about murder, play guitar, play video games with
                        Matthew, and smother Midnight with love.

                    <p>
                        Rupert is a very large and lazy Pac-man frog. He likes to munch on crickets from the comfort and
                        safety of his burrow. Occasionally you will see him leave his
                        burrow if he bombs it with one of his famous poops. He leads a very simple lifestyle and does
                        not appreciate his little brother napping on his tank.

                        Midnight is a crazy tuxedo kitty Emma and Matt kidnapped from the side of the road in Stansbury,
                        UT. He was originally thought to be a girl but unfortunately his
                        second ball just never dropped. He loves playing with his pickle, his mouse, and his string.
                        Midnight is the definition of a street-born gangster who likes his
                        whipped cream cold and his treats crunchy.

                        Semiformal Red and Black attire, the small red card you got with your invitation (excluding
                        Matt's family), is the preferred. If you cannot find that exact shade, don't worrry, just find
                        the closest color to that red that you can. Wear something you are comfortable wearing in red or
                        black, we do ask that there are no jeans and no T-shirts. Emma's family will be in red, Matt's
                        will be in black, and friends will have the option of black, red, or both to wear.
